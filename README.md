Genome Assembly is currently in a renaissance, with new technologies coming together to complement each other, producing high-quality reference grade assemblies. This workshop will focus on project design, library and sequencing technologies, genome assembly and data type integration process, and evaluation in a practical and informative setting.

The format will be approximately half lecture and half hands-on. The hands-on portion of the workshop will  involve command-line interaction with some R, therefore prior command-line and R experience is a must to fully participate. If you are not familiar with the command line but would like to attend, listen, and learn that is OK, but we will be unable to train you in how to use the command-line and R during this workshop.

Participants must supply their own laptop/desktop with a reliable connection to the internet. The labtop/desktop should have a current versions of [R version 4.0](https://cloud.r-project.org/), [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (see this [page](https://ucdavis-bioinformatics-training.github.io/2020-Genome_Assembly_Workshop/prerequisites/cli/logging-in))

The registration fee is $1,000 for UC students, postdocs, staff and faculty, $1,200 for Non-UC academic or non-profit participants and $1,700 for other participants. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment.

### FAQ


**Who should attend?** … Prior course participants have included faculty, post docs, grad students, staff, and industry researchers.

**What are the prerequisites?** … The hands-on portion of the workshop will  involve command-line interaction with some R, therefore prior command-line and R experience is a must to fully participate. If you are not familiar with the command line but would like to attend, listen, and learn that is OK, **but we will be unable to train you in how to use the command-line during this workshop**.

**What do I need to bring?** … You will need to bring your own laptop to use, and an application that will allow you to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for windows, or terminal for Apple OSX). Computational exercises will be performed on a remote server. We can help with setup early on in the workshop. If your department does not allow you to install software on the laptop you’ll be bringing, please contact us ahead of time.

**Can I bring my own data?** … We will provide datasets for use during the workshop, as this helps to keep the workshop moving. There may be time, however, to discuss your own datasets and how you might work with them outside of the workshop.

**How much does it cost?** … The registration fee is $1,000 for UC students, postdocs, staff and faculty, $1,200 for Non-UC academic or non-profit participants and $1,700 for other participants. Late registrations (less than one month prior to the start of the workshop) are subject to a 20% fee increase. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment.

**How do I apply?** … All registration is “first-come, first-served”. There is no application process.  So, sign up as soon as possible to ensure your place in the workshop.
